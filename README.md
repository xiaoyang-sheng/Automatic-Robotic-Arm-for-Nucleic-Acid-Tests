# Automatic-Robotic-Arm-for-Nucleic-Acid-Tests
Project of SJTU VE373: Design of Microprocessor Based Systems

# Group:
Xiaoyang Sheng, Tiancheng He, Zeyu Sun

# Introduction:
Nucleic Acid Testing Helper is a PIC-32 driven robot that achieves functions that medical staff can send the orders by remote control of Bluetooth to make 
the robotic arms accomplish the nucleic acid test without close contact.
